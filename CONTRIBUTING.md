# Contributors guide v0.1

## How I can help?

We are always really happy to help you in contributing to Watermill. If you have any idea, please ask us on the [Slack](https://github.com/ThreeDotsLabs/watermill#support).

They are multiple ways on how you can help us.

### Existing issues

You can pick one of the existing issues. Most of the issues should have an estimation (S - small, M - medium, L - large).

- [Good first issues list](https://github.com/ThreeDotsLabs/watermill/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) - simple issues to start
- [Help wanted issues list](https://github.com/ThreeDotsLabs/watermill/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) - tasks, which are already more or less clear, and you can start to implement them pretty quickly

### New Pub/Sub implementations

If you have the idea to create Pub/Sub based on some technology, and it is not listed (because we don't know it, or it is just crazy idea like physical mail based Pub/Sub) you can also feel free to add your implementation.
You can do it in your private repository or if you want we can move it to `ThreeDotsLabs/watermill-[name]`.

*Please keep in mind, that you will be not able to push changes directly to master to project in our organization*.

When you are implementing new Pub/Sub implementation, you should start with this guide: [https://watermill.io/docs/pub-sub-implementing/](https://watermill.io/docs/pub-sub-implementing/).

### New ideas

If you have any idea that is not covered in the issues list, please post a new issue with your idea. 
It's recommended to discuss your idea on Slack/GitHub before creating production-ready implementation - in some situations, it may save a lot of your time before implementing something which may be simplified or done more easily :)

Sometimes, it's also really nice to discuss Proof of Concept to align with the idea.

## Local development

Makefile and docker-compose (for Pub/Subs) are your friends. You can run all tests locally (they are running in CI in the same way).

Useful commands:
- `make up` - docker-compose up
- `make test` - tests
- `make test_short` - run short tests (useful to have very fast check after changes)
- `make fmt` - do goimports

## Code standards

- you should run `make fmt`
- [CodeReviewComments](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CodeReviewComments)
- [Effective Go](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html)
- SOLID
- code should be open for configuration and not coupled to any serialization method (for example: [AMQP marshaler](https://github.com/ThreeDotsLabs/watermill-amqp/blob/master/pkg/amqp/marshaler.go), [AMQP Config](https://github.com/ThreeDotsLabs/watermill-amqp/blob/master/pkg/amqp/config.go)
